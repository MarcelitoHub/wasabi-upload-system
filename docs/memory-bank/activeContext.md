# BestReviews Asset Management - Active Context

## Current Focus

The most recent work on the BestReviews Asset Management system has focused on **asset management capabilities**, adding search functionality alongside upload and deletion capabilities, building on our previous work on folder inventory management and permission management.

### Recent Major Changes

1. **Asset Search Implementation**:
   - Created `find_asset.py` for finding assets by filename across the entire bucket
   - Added features for case-insensitive and partial matching
   - Implemented CSV export of search results
   - Added integration with bulk deletion workflow
   - Optimized for performance with large buckets using pagination

2. **Asset Upload Implementation**:
   - Created `upload_asset.py` for uploading assets to the bucket
   - Added option to make assets public during upload
   - Implemented automatic folder creation for new assets
   - Added performance metrics and logging for uploads
   - Integrated with existing permission management pattern

3. **Asset Deletion Implementation**:
   - Created `delete_asset.py` for deleting individual assets from the bucket
   - Implemented `bulk_delete_assets.py` for bulk deletion operations
   - Added safety features including dry-run mode, confirmation prompts, and operation limits
   - Implemented logging and reporting for all deletion operations
   - Created CSV-based reporting with timestamps for audit trails
   - Fixed BOM character handling in CSV files for improved reliability

4. **Folder Inventory Implementation**:
   - Created `list_bucket_folders.py` script to retrieve all folders in the bucket
   - Implemented pagination for handling large buckets efficiently
   - Added recursive subfolder discovery
   - Included prefix filtering capabilities for targeted folder listing
   - Generated timestamped CSV reports for folder inventory

5. **Permission Update Implementation**:
   - Created `make_objects_public.py` script to set public-read ACL for all objects
   - Implemented both test mode (for random folder samples) and full execution mode
   - Added comprehensive reporting with timestamped CSV files
   - Introduced progress tracking with performance metrics

6. **Memory Bank Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive documentation of the system
   - Documented technical implementation, patterns, and context
   - Established reference materials for future development

## Current System State

The asset management system has several components in place:

1. **Connection Testing**: `wasabi_test.py` for verifying Wasabi connectivity
2. **Data Validation**: `file_test.py` for validating CSV metadata structure
3. **Folder Structure**: `create_folders.py` for establishing category/subcategory hierarchy
4. **Asset Migration**: `copy_files.py` for copying assets to the organized structure
5. **Asset Reporting**: `br_assets_files.py` for generating asset inventories
6. **Permission Management**: `make_objects_public.py` for updating object permissions
7. **Folder Inventory**: `list_bucket_folders.py` for comprehensive folder structure analysis
8. **Asset Deletion**: `delete_asset.py` and `bulk_delete_assets.py` for removing assets
9. **Asset Upload**: `upload_asset.py` for adding new assets with optional public permissions
10. **Asset Search**: `find_asset.py` for locating assets by filename across the bucket

All components are functional, with the asset search component being the most recently developed.

## Active Decisions

### Asset Search Strategy

For the asset search implementation, we chose an approach that:
- Searches the entire bucket by default but allows prefix-based scope limiting
- Offers both exact filename matching and partial (contains) matching
- Provides case-sensitive and case-insensitive search options
- Exports results to CSV for integration with the bulk deletion workflow
- Uses pagination to efficiently handle large buckets
- Displays real-time progress for large searches

This approach provides a powerful way to locate assets by filename regardless of their location in the bucket hierarchy, addressing a key operational need for finding specific assets without knowing their exact path.

### Asset Upload Strategy

For the asset upload implementation, we chose an approach that:
- Provides control over public/private access at upload time
- Creates folder structures automatically if they don't exist
- Confirms before overwriting existing files
- Logs all uploads with timestamps and public/private status
- Reports upload performance metrics

This approach provides a more streamlined workflow than the previous pattern, which required:
1. Uploading assets without setting permissions
2. Running a separate script (`make_objects_public.py`) to set permissions

The new approach maintains compatibility with the existing system while providing a more efficient option for new uploads.

### Asset Deletion Strategy

For the asset deletion implementation, we chose an approach that:
- Provides both single-asset and bulk deletion capabilities
- Includes safety features like dry-run mode, confirmation prompts, and operation limits
- Implements comprehensive logging and reporting for audit trails
- Allows for prefix-based deletion (folder/category deletion) and CSV-based deletion
- Handles large operations with progress tracking and performance metrics
- Processes files with BOM characters for improved reliability

This approach was selected over alternatives like:
- Direct bucket lifecyle rules (which would be too broad and less targeted)
- GUI-based deletion tools (which wouldn't integrate with our existing pipeline)
- Batch deletion without safety measures (which would be too risky)

### Security Considerations

The current implementation includes hardcoded credentials in each script. While this works for internal tooling, future enhancements should:
- Move credentials to environment variables or a secure credential store
- Implement temporary session tokens where possible
- Consider implementing IAM-based access controls

## Next Steps

Potential future enhancements to the system could include:

1. **Credential Management**: Removing hardcoded credentials in favor of secure alternatives
2. **Automation**: Scheduling regular runs for permission checks and updates
3. **Asset Validation**: Tools to verify asset integrity and metadata consistency
4. **Interface Development**: Creating a simple UI for managing operations
5. **Monitoring**: Adding CloudWatch or similar monitoring for bucket operations
6. **Deletion Policy**: Implementing retention policies and scheduled cleanup
7. **Recovery Tools**: Adding capabilities to recover recently deleted assets
8. **Bulk Upload**: Enhancing upload capabilities to handle multiple files and directories
9. **Advanced Search**: Expanding search capabilities to include metadata, tags, and other attributes
