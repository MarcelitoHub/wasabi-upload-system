- **Permission Management**
  - Public access control for all assets (`make_objects_public.py`)
  - Selective processing with test mode
  - Detailed reporting and progress tracking

- **Asset Deletion**
  - Single asset deletion with confirmation (`delete_asset.py`)
  - Bulk deletion with multiple safety features (`bulk_delete_assets.py`)
  - Comprehensive logging and reporting

- **Asset Upload**
  - Direct file upload with public/private option (`upload_asset.py`)
  - Automatic folder creation for new assets
  - Performance metrics and logging
  - Overwrite protection with confirmation

- **Asset Search**
  - Filename-based search across entire bucket (`find_asset.py`)
  - Support for case-sensitive/insensitive matching
  - Partial matching and exact matching options
  - Prefix limiting for scoped searches
  - CSV export of search results
  - Integration with bulk deletion workflow

  - Searching for assets by filename
  
- **Permission Management**
  - Checking current object ACLs
  - Setting object ACLs to public-read
  - Tracking already-public objects
  - Setting permissions during upload
  
- **Reporting**
  - CSV generation for successful operations
  - CSV generation for failed operations
  - Progress tracking with performance metrics
  - Timestamped reports for audit trails
  - Search results export

- **Safety Features**
  - Dry-run mode for previewing operations
  - Confirmation prompts for destructive actions
  - Operation limits for bulk processes
  - Error isolation and continue-on-error options
  - Comprehensive logging for auditing
  - Overwrite protection for uploads
  - BOM character handling in CSV files

## Current Status

### Overall System Status: **OPERATIONAL**

All core components of the BestReviews Asset Management system are operational and have been successfully implemented, including the recently added asset search, upload, and deletion capabilities.

### Component Status
| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Connection Testing | ‚úÖ Functional | Successfully verifies Wasabi connectivity |
| Data Validation | ‚úÖ Functional | CSV structure validation works |
| Folder Structure | ‚úÖ Completed | Category/subcategory hierarchy established |
| Asset Migration | ‚úÖ Completed | Assets copied to organized structure |
| Asset Reporting | ‚úÖ Functional | Inventory generation works |
| Permission Management | ‚úÖ Completed | All assets made public successfully |
| Folder Inventory | ‚úÖ Functional | Comprehensive folder discovery with CSV reports |
| Asset Deletion | ‚úÖ Functional | Both single and bulk deletion capabilities implemented |
| Asset Upload | ‚úÖ Functional | Upload with optional public permissions and automatic folder creation |
| Asset Search | ‚úÖ Functional | Filename-based search with CSV export and deletion integration |

## What's Left to Build

### üî≤ Potential Enhancements

1. **Security Improvements**
   - Remove hardcoded credentials
   - Implement secure credential management
   - Apply IAM-based access control

2. **Automation & Scheduling**
   - Add scheduled permission verification
   - Automate new asset processing
   - Set up monitoring for bucket changes

3. **User Interface**
   - Develop simple admin console
   - Create operation dashboards
   - Visualize asset structure

4. **Advanced Features**
   - Asset deduplication capabilities
   - Metadata enrichment
   - Image processing/optimization
   - Asset recovery/undelete functionality
   - Retention policies and scheduled cleanup
   - Bulk upload capabilities for multiple files/folders
   - Advanced search with metadata, tags, and other attributes

### üî≤ Technical Improvements

1. **Code Refactoring**
   - Create shared utility modules
   - Unify credential management
   - Implement consistent error handling

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Batch processing for large operations
   - Parallel processing where applicable
   - Optimize listing operations

## Known Issues

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Code Issues
1. `br_assets_files.py` has a reference to an undefined `df` variable
2. All scripts contain hardcoded credentials (security concern)
3. Limited validation of CSV structure before processing

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Process Issues
1. No automatic verification of permissions after changes
2. Manual execution of each pipeline step required
3. No notification system for failed operations

## Next Priorities

If continuing development, these would be the recommended next priorities:

1. Fix the reference issue in `br_assets_files.py`
2. Implement secure credential management
3. Create a unified utility module for common functions
4. Add automated verification of public permissions
5. Develop basic monitoring for critical bucket changes
6. Implement asset recovery capabilities
7. Create retention policies for automated cleanup
8. Enhance upload capabilities to handle multiple files/directories
9. Expand search capabilities to include metadata and tags
